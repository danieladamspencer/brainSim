Description: The only exported functions so far are the simulate_cifti and 
    simulate_cifti_multiple functions, which can be used to simulate cifti 
    objects with spatially-defined areas of activation and autocorrelated 
    errors for single subject, single session datasets (simulate_cifti) or
    a user-specified number of subjects, sessions, and runs 
    (simulate_cifti_multiple).
