Code for simulating cifti data objects and design matrices with spatial activation effects and autocorrelated spatially-dependent error terms

## What can this do now?
Currently, this can simulate single-run cifti timeseries (*dtseries.nii) objects within R with a user-specified number of tasks, at varible resolution, and with autocorrelated noise.

## What do I hope this will do in the future?
I hope to do a better job of accounting for a spatially-varying mean field, as well as incorporating spatially-varying noise. There are also plans to perform subcortical and cerebellum simulation.
